# CHL2

CHL2 is a Common HTML & CSS Library, similar to other libraries such as the Yahoo User Interface Library. 

It's not necessarily better than those other frameworks, but is exists because they didn't at the time. Besides, it has stood the test of time and has been used in hundreds of projects. 

It is used extensively by Datalink (www.datalink.com.au) and its partners.
